## Millennia Severino

I am a human , made of compiled dust and trillions of atoms and my purpose in life is to simply be. My enthusiasm for coding came from dabbling with Python and the exciting world of machine learning aswell as apps like Olio and Tiktok, which serve the community in their own ways. Focusing on the positive, these apps have allowed us to connect to eachother without the farse of being someone else, and have helped eachother by either sharing things or sharing experiences and knowledge. I want to be connected and be a part of that. Learning new languages, working with exciting projects and meeting the most amazing people along the way of my journey into Tech, has only really empowered me to keep growing to make a positive difference not only to my life, but in those around me. 

I would like to work at a company that also shares my goal of moving the world forward and creating real, tangible benefits for society. Having now graduated from Makers, I am eager to use my tenacity, rapidly developing tech skills and love of the community to help them achieve this.
