## Millennia Severino

My enthusiasm for coding came from dabbling with Python and the exciting world of machine learning aswell as apps like Olio and Tiktok, which serve the community in their own ways. Focusing on the positive, these apps have allowed us to connect to eachother without the farse of being someone else, and have helped eachother by either sharing things or sharing experiences and knowledge. I want to be connected and be a part of that. Learning new languages, working with exciting projects and meeting the most amazing people along the way of my journey into Tech, has only really empowered me to keep growing to make a positive difference not only to my life, but in those around me. 

I would like to work at a company that also shares my goal of moving the world forward and creating real, tangible benefits for society. Having now graduated from Makers, I am eager to use my tenacity, rapidly developing tech skills and love of the community to help them achieve this.

## <a name="skills">What I bring to the table (Skills) üëè</a>

#### Excellent communicator, presenter and mentor ####

During my role as Junior Head Coach at LVHTC, I managed a team of 6 coaches of all ages and backgrounds. I became a student and a teacher simutaneously at the same time. Learning how to approach individuals and guiding them through any difficulties they had. I grew myself as a person and my commnications skills developed to jump from a 1-2-1 setting to a proffessional pitch of new ideas to my managers, adapting to the environment around me. 

#### Self-reliant individual and significantly contributory team member ####

During on of the projects at Makers as a team we managed our time and expectations. The planning process was really useful and fun. I really enjoed the team aspect aswell as working in an agile environment. I was lucky enough to always have a great time in team projects even when we faced conflicts, we would always learn and develop which is the aim at the end of the day.

#### Fast learner, effective timekeeping skills, and experienced project management ####

#### Highly analytical thinker and innovative problem solver ####
